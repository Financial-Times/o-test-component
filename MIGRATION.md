## Migration

As a test component usual release rules do not apply. Breaking changes will be released as minor or patch versions, for example to test how services behave with an invalid component. However major releases may be made as a helpful way to group test releases.

### Migrating from v1 to v2
All v1 o-test-component versions were created to test v1 of the Origami component specification. The v2 release of `o-test-component` was created to indicate tests used to develop v2 of the Origami component specification.
