_2.2.x versions match the corresponding patch version in the table above. However they have a number of additional failures related to changes made in the draft v2 version of the Origami specification, including the renaming of some `origami.json` keys._

## Migration Guide
As a test component usual release rules do not apply. Breaking changes will be released as minor or patch versions, for example to test how services behave with an invalid component. However major releases may be made as a helpful way to group test releases. See the [migration guide](MIGRATION.md) for details.
